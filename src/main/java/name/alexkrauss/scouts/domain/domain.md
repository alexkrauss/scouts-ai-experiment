# Domain of the Scouts application.

Scouts is a web application for managing data for a scout organization. Its main
purpose is to track registration of scouts for events. It aims to make the process
digital, to avoid repetitive paperwork.


## Overview

* The organization consists of several *groups*, who participate in events.
* *Scouts* are the individuals that form a group. Scouts may belong to multiple groups.
* *Events* are happenings for which the individuals must register. Events are often 
  attended by multiple groups, but not all groups always participate in all events.
* *Registrations* are the act of a scout registering for an event. They are created by scouts
  themselves or rather their parents.
* *Accounts* are used to log into the system. They usually belong to the parents of the scouts,
  as they are the ones registering the scouts for events.


## Entities

### Scout

Scouts have 

* a name,
* a birthdate
* an address
* a phone number (optional)
* the name of the health insurance
* allergy information (may be empty)
* vaccination information (may be empty)

Furthermore, they have an ordered list of contacts, which are usually the parents of the scout.
A contact is a name, a phone number, an email adress and a field describing the relationship,
e.g. (mother, father, guardian). At least one contact is mandatory. Contacts are not entities
but modeled as value objects.

There is also a field indicating when the data was last updated or checked.
