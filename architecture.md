# Architecture decisions

This is a web app backend. We record technical decisions here.
Domain information can be found in the file domain.md.

Note that each subfolder may have its own architecture.md file,
describing the architecture of that subfolder and the code patterns
used there.

## Frameworks and Libraries

### Used frameworks and libraries

* Java 21
* Spring Boot
* jOOQ for data access
* Flyway for database migrations

#### Details on Spring Boot

We use the following Spring Boot modules:
* Spring Boot Web
* jOOQ integration
* Spring Boot Actuator
* Spring Boot Starter Test

## Persistence

We use PostgreSQL as the primary database.
For testing, we use an in-memory H2 database.

## Build

The build system is Gradle, using the gradle wrapper to ensure
the correct Gradle version.

The result of the build is a fat jar, as well as a docker image.

## APIs

* The APIs are given using an OpenAPI specification. We follow
  a contract-first approach where code is generated from the API
  spec using the OpenAPI generator.

## Observability

For logging, we use Spring-boot's defaults.

We also collect metrics using Spring Boot Actuator, using the
micrometer API. We expose a prometheus endpoint.


## Testing Strategy

* Unit tests with JUnit 5
* Integration tests with Spring Boot Test
* API tests with REST Assured
* Code coverage tracked with JaCoCo


## Scalability

* Stateless application design for horizontal scaling
* Use of distributed caching to reduce database load
* Consideration for future implementation of microservices architecture

## Internal service architecture.

We use hexagonal architecture. The layout is as follows

    root
    |-- domain
        |-- model
    |-- application
        |-- ports
            |-- persistence
        |-- service
    |-- infrastructure
        |-- db
        |-- rest

Only the following dependencies are allowed:
* application -> domain
* infrastructure -> application
* infrastructure -> domain

We do not distinguish between primary/inbound and secondary/outbound ports.
